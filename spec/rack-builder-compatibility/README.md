RackStack - Rack::Builder compatibility
=======================================

RackStack was originally test-driven using Rack's specs for [Rack::Builder](https://github.com/rack/rack/blob/master/test/spec_builder.rb)
and [Rack::URLMap](https://github.com/rack/rack/blob/master/test/spec_urlmap.rb)

Here, you'll find a [compatibility test](https://github.com/remi/rack-stack/blob/master/rack-builder-compatibility/rack_builder_compatibility_spec.rb)
that we run against RackStack to ensure that it behaves like Rack's counter parts.
