RackStack
=========

`RackStack` is a fully managed stack of Rack applications (*inspired by [Rack::Builder][]*)

```ruby
RackStack.new do
  use MyMiddleware
  map "/admin" do
    run AdminApp.new
  end
  run MyApp.new
end
```

If you're familar with Rack::Builder, that should look very familiar!

RackStack's API is actually intended to be [compatible with Rack::Builder's][compatibility].

RackStack adds a few features to Rack::Builder

 1. Use as Middleware
 1. Named Applications
 1. Conditional Logic

Use as Middleware
-----------------

A Rack application generated by a Rack::Builder can only be run as a Rack endpoint,
not as a middleware.

RackStack can be run as either a Rack endpoint or a Rack middleware.

```ruby
Rack::Builder.new {
  use SomeMiddleware

  # RackStack can be used as a middleware, alongside your existing Rack components
  use RackStack.new do
    use AnotherMiddleware, when: { path_info: /foo/ }
    run SomeApplication.new, when: { path_info: /bar/ }
  end

  # Or RackStack can be used as a Rack endpoint.
  run RackStack.new do
    run AnotherApplication.new  
  end
}.to_app
```

Named Applications
------------------

add names ...

remove ...

get access to...


Conditional Logic
-----------------

```ruby
stack = RackStack.new do
  use MyMiddleware, when: { path_info: /^\/aboutus/ }
  map "/admin" do
    run AdminApp.new, when: ->{|request| request.path_info =~ /^\/aboutus/ }
  end
  run MyApp.new, when: ->{ path_info =~ /^\/aboutus/ }
end
```

RackStack allows you to easily add conditional logic for `:when` to `#run`, `#use`, or `#map` a rack component.
