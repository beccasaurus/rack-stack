RackStack
=========

`RackStack` is a fully managed stack of Rack applications (*inspired by [Rack::Builder][]*)

Installation
------------

Using Bundler:

```ruby
gem "rack-stack"
```

Or just `gem install rack-stack`

Usage
-----

```ruby
require "rack/stack" # or "rack-stack"

rack_stack = RackStack.new do
  use MyMiddleware
  map "/admin" do
    run AdminApp.new
  end
  run MyApp.new
end

# A RackStack instance is a Rack application, so you can #call it.
rack_stack.call(env)
```
If you're familar with Rack::Builder, that should look very familiar!

RackStack's API is actually intended to be [compatible with Rack::Builder's][compatibility].

RackStack offers a number of additional features:

 1. Conditional Logic
 1. Named Components
 1. Stack Manipulation
 1. Use as Middleware

Use Cases
---------

Any scenario where you want to mount many Rack applications together into 1 application.

RackStack can be used as a Rack Router (by making use of `:when` conditions and/or `#map` statements).

RackStack can be particularly useful for managing mock web APIs in tests, eg. when using [Artifice][].  ([RackStack Artifice sample](https://github.com/remi/rack-stack/tree/master/spec/sample-use-cases/artifice))

Conditional Logic
-----------------

RackStack allows you to easily add conditional logic for `:when` to `#run`, `#use`, or `#map` a Rack component.

```ruby
RackStack.new do

  # When a block is given with 1 argument, the current request will be yielded (as a Rack::Request)
  use MyMiddleware, when: ->(request){ request.path_info =~ /about-us/ }

  # When a block is given with no arguments, the block is evaluated against the current request
  use MyMiddleware, when: ->{ path_info =~ /about-us/ }

  # When a Hash (or Array of pairs) is given, each value will be compared against the value from the 
  # current request.  In this example, the following would be evaluated: /about-us/ === "<the path info>"
  use MyMiddleware, when: { path_info: /about-us/ }

end
```

Named Components
----------------

RackStack allows you to name any of your Rack components.

```ruby
@rack_stack = RackStack.new do
  use :cool_middleware, CoolMiddleware
  map :foo, "/foo" do
    run :foo_app, FooApp.new
  end
  run :main, MainApp.new
end
```

### Getting components by name

By providing names for our middleware/maps/endoints, you can easily access 
these instances via `RackStack#get`.

```ruby
# For middleware, the instance of the middleware that we create & use to process requests is returned.
@rack_stack.get(:cool_middleware)
# => #<CoolMiddleware:0x000000015fb520>

# For endpoints, the application instance is returned.
@rack_stack.get(:main)
# => #<MainApp:0x000000015db7a8>

# Components nested within maps are returned too.
@rack_stack.get(:foo_app)
# => #<FooApp:0x000000015fb740>

# For maps, the RackStack instance (representing the nested map) is returned.
@rack_stack.get(:foo)
# => #<RackStack:0x000000015cf840>
```

We also provide some useful shortcuts for `RackStack#get`

```ruby
@rack_stack.get(:cool_middleware)
# => #<CoolMiddleware:0x000000015fb520>

# Get is aliased to [], so this also works.
@rack_stack[:cool_middleware]

# We also have a method_missing implementation, so this also works.
@rack_stack.cool_middleware
@rack_stack.respond_to? :cool_middleware # => true
```

### Removing components

Names are particularly useful for removing components from a RackStack.

```ruby
# RackStack#remove removes every Rack component with the given name from the stack.
@rack_stack.remove :cool_middleware
```

Stack Manipulation
------------------

A `RackStack` may be manipulated at runtime.

```ruby
rack_stack = RackStack.new

# You can run the RackStack or something else, eg. mount it with Artifice
some_rack_server.run(rack_stack)

# #use, #run, and #map may be used at runtime
rack_stack.use :my_middleware, SomeMiddleware
rack_stack.run SomeApp.new, when: { host: "someapp.com" }
rack_stack.map "/foo" do
  use FooMiddleware
  run FooApp.new
end

# Feel free to #remove named applications
rack_stack.remove :my_middleware

# You can also manipulate the stack Array directly.
#
# For example, if you want to put a #use statement *first*, you can:
rack_stack.stack.unshift RackStack::Use.new(:my_middleware, SomeMiddleware)

# Note that #use/map/run statements are manually reproduced by passing the 
# same arguments to the constructors of RackStack::Use/Map/Run classes.
```

Use as Middleware
-----------------

A Rack application generated by a Rack::Builder can only be run as a Rack endpoint,
not as a middleware.

RackStack can be run as either a Rack endpoint or a Rack middleware.

```ruby
# Example of using RackStack as a middleware (app built using an ordinary Rack::Builder)
Rack::Builder.new {

  use SomeMiddleware

  # RackStack can be used as a middleware, alongside your existing Rack components
  use RackStack.new when: { host: "foo.com" } do
    use AnotherMiddleware
    run SomeApplication.new
  end

  # Or RackStack can be used as a Rack endpoint.
  run RackStack.new do
    run AnotherApplication.new  
  end

}.to_app
```
